This is the primary repository for public Gen3 technical documentation.  It is designed to be easy for the Gen3 community to participate in the update of this content.  

# Documentation Release
Gen3 docs release numbers parallel those used for the Gen3 software.  You can find old documentation releases on the [docs GitHub home page](https://github.com/uc-cdis/docs-gen3).  You can find information about the relevant Gen3 software releases in the [cdis-manifest repo](https://github.com/uc-cdis/cdis-manifest/tree/master/releases).

# How to request updates
Create an issue within this repo to report on issues or gaps in the documentation.  If it is a large change you would like to see, it is better to start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/uc-cdis/docs-gen3/issues/new/choose).

If it is something small and you are comfortable using GitHub please just create a pull request and we can review that.

# Steps to create your own changes and submit them

If you know what changes are needed we encourage you to create a PR.  Follow these steps to make changes and verify them.

## Install MkDocs

Please follow instructions found [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) to install MkDocs on your local machine.

## Clone docs-gen3 repo locally

Clone the current `main` branch of the docs-gen3 repo. Create a new branch.  Make your changes and commit to your branch.  Follow naming conventions for branches and commits described in the [code contribution section of the docs](https://github.com/uc-cdis/docs-gen3/blob/Update-to-readme/docs/gen3-resources/developer-guide/contribute.md#naming-conventions).

## Serve docs repo locally to verify changes

Display your changes locally by serving the site using the command `mkdocs serve`.  Make any changes necessary so your new documentation renders correctly and no errors or warning are generated in the terminal.

Note, you should not need to build the site using `mkdocs build`.

## Submit your PR

Once you submit your PR, a member of the CTDS staff may request changes or ask you questions regarding your update.
