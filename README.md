This is the primary repository for public Gen3 technical documentation.  It is designed to be easy for the Gen3 community to participate in the update of this content.  

# Documentation Release
Gen3 docs release numbers parallel those used for the Gen3 software.  You can find old documentation releases on the [docs GitHub home page](https://github.com/uc-cdis/docs-gen3).  You can find information about the relevant Gen3 software releases in the [cdis-manifest repo](https://github.com/uc-cdis/cdis-manifest/tree/master/releases).

# How to request updates
Create an issue within this repo to report on issues or gaps in the documentation.  If it is a large change you would like to see, it is better to start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/uc-cdis/docs-gen3/issues/new/choose).

If it is something small and you are comfortable using GitHub please just create a pull request and we can review that.

# Steps to create your own changes and submit them
